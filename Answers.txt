Q1. What is your favourite state management library for react and why? 
Ans. Redux is my favorite state management library because there is a central store that holds the 
     entire state of an application. Each component can access the stored state without having to send 
     down props from one component to another.

Q2. Write some react native best practices.
Ans. 1. Key of each element in a list should be unique
     2. Use Redux for state management.
     3. Optimize images and store them in cloud storage
     4. Use global variables for font sizes and colors
     5. Lock your library dependencies

Q3. Which coding style you prefer wet or dry and why?
Ans. I prefer DRY coding style.
     DRY is a software development principle, the main aim of which is to reduce repetition of code.
     I prefer DRY coding style because it allows me to:
     1. Debug code easily.
     2. Enhance Readability of the code
     3. Allow reusing code
     4. Reduce cost as writeing more code increases code.
     5. Testing is easier.

Q4. What do you prefer expo or vanilla react native and why?
Ans. It depends on scenario I have to work in. If getting access to the native code is necessary for a 
     project I prefer vanilla react native otherwise I prefer expo.
     However, usually I prefer using expo for my projects because:
     1. It is easy to use.
     2. Gives immediate results
     3. It has a very good documentation
     4. Live reload while in development
     5. Library linking not necessary
     6. Test directly on device both for iOS and Android (through the Expo Go app) 
     7. Develop from Windows/MacOS or whatever (you only need nodejs and an internet connection)
     8. Everything is covered by Expo
